##for developers
IntelligeN is build using Embarcadero® Delphi® 2010 Professional. The source code is split up in three parts: The CORE, SDK and VIEW folders. The CORE folder contains constants, interfaces and functions used by the SDK and VIEW part. The SDK folder contains files required by the VIEW, the plugins and the toolchain. Finally, the VIEW folder contains the graphical user interface of IntelligeN 2009.
